## Business Problem

The current offerings of movie streaming platforms lack collaborative content viewing and integrated content discussion similar to the movie theater experience. This lapse in functionality results in users unable to watch movies together if those movies aren’t showing in theaters or users aren’t able to meet in person. Also users are not able to discuss what they liked, disliked, or found interesting about the movie they just watched on the same platform they watched it on. In conclusion, current movie streaming platforms are unable to provide the same collaborative functionality that is common with the movie theater experience, our team will solve that issue with our collaborative movie streaming platform
